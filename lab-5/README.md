## A little explanation:

Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are implemented in the corresponding folders:

- [Task-1-Chain-of-Responsibility](src%2FTask-1-Chain-of-Responsibility)
- [Task-2-Intermediary](src%2FTask-2-Intermediary)
- [Task-3-Observer](src%2FTask-3-Observer)
- [Task-4-Strategy](src%2FTask-4-Strategy)
- [Task-5-Memento](src%2FTask-5-Memento)


In the main method [main.ts](src%2Fmain.ts) the launch of each task is implemented through functions that are commented by default.
